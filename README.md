## NFC Principle ðŸ§²
<b>[NFC (Near Field Communication)](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/what-is-near-field-communication/)</b> is a group of communication protocols that allows for low speed wireless communication between two electronic devices. 
* NFC communication occurs when both electronic devices are within a distance of 4cm or less. 
* NFC operates at 13.56 MHz on ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface and at rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s.
* The transfer of data in NFC is bi-directional.
* NFC has a setup time of 0.1s. For reference, Bluetooth requires a setup time of 6s.
* NFC utilizes the phenomenon of inductive coupling between two electromagnetic coils.

## NFC IC ðŸ“¶
THe NFC IC being used in this project is the [NT3H1101W0FHKH](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/nxp-usa-inc/NT3H1101W0FHKH/5215136).
* This chip is an NFC chip designed by NXP. It features I2C communication, energy harvesting, and field detection features. 
* It features 64 bytes of SRAM and 1kB of EEPROM memory. We can use the onboard memory to stored a personal website link for the user device to retrieve when communicating with the IC.
* Lastly with this chip, we can utilize the induced current to power the chip (i.e., energy harvesting).
* We can program the IC through the [NFC TagWriter by NXP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.nfc.tagwriter&hl=en_GB) app.

## NFC Equivalent Circuit
The internet has a plethora of resources for antenna design. The two sources I will be referring to for this design are:
* [AN11276 - NXP Community](https://community.nxp.com/pwmxy87654/attachments/pwmxy87654/nfc/6155/1/AN11276.pdf)
* [AN2972 Application note How to design an antenna for dynamic NFC tags](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/an2972-how-to-design-an-antenna-for-dynamic-nfc-tags-stmicroelectronics.pdf)

The figure below shows the equivalent electrical circuits of the dynamic NFC tag and its antenna.

<p align="center">
    <img title="NFC Equivalent Circuit" alt="NFC Equivalent Circuit" src="./Images/Equivalent_Circuit.png" width ="75%">
</p>

The above circuit can be simplified into an equivalent RLC circuit.

<p align="center">
    <img title="NFC RLC Circuit" alt="NFC RLC Circuit" src="./Images/Simplified_Equivalent_Circuit.png" width ="75%">
</p>

### Resonance Frequency
Based on the simplified RLC circuit we can determine the resonant frequency. 
* Resonance frequency is the frequency (in hertz) in which a signal or power level can be carried, or couple from one device to another with no power or signal loss "ideally".
* $f_R=\frac{1}{2\cdot \pi \cdot \sqrt{L_{pc}\cdot C_{pl}}}$
    * $C_{pl}=C_{tun}+C_{ant}$

We know that for an NFC tag, the desired frequency is 13.56 MHz. We also know that the IC's parallel capacitance is 50 pF (from the datasheet). <i>Ignore the parasitic capacitance of the antenna for now; we will come back to that</i>. Based on this information, we can work backwards to determine the required inductance of the antenna.

$f_R=\frac{1}{2\cdot \pi \cdot \sqrt{L_{pc}\cdot C_{pl}}}$

$L_{pc}=\frac{1}{C_{pl}\left(2\pi f_R\right)^2}$

$L_{pc}=\frac{1}{5\cdot 10^{-11}\left(2\pi \cdot 13560000\right)^2} = 0.00000275518$

$L_{pc}=0.00000275518\:H=\:2.75518\:uH$

## Antenna Design ðŸ“¡
We can now design an NFC antenna based on the desired inductance calculated above. To design the antenna I referred to various resources to confirm my calculations. 

### NXP Spiral Antenna Calculation
The [AN11276 NTAG Antenna Design Guide](https://community.nxp.com/pwmxy87654/attachments/pwmxy87654/nfc/6155/1/AN11276.pdf) provides the following information to design an antenna.

I utilized the [Antenna_Shape_Calculator](/Resource_Documents/Antenna_Shape_Calculator.xlsx) excel document to calculate the geometric parameters. They were as follows:
* $D_0 = 41mm$
* $t = 35um$
* $w = 300um$
* $g = 300um$
* $Nant = 6\:turns$
* $L_{calc} = 2.754uH$

### STM Spiral Antenna Calculation
The [AN2972 Application note](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/an2972-how-to-design-an-antenna-for-dynamic-nfc-tags-stmicroelectronics.pdf) provides the following information to design an antenna.

I utilized the [Antenna_Shape_Calculator](/Resource_Documents/Antenna_Shape_Calculator.xlsx) excel document to calculate the geometric parameters. They were as follows:
* $r_{in} = 17.5mm$
* $r_{out} = 20.5mm$
* $Nant = 6\:turns$
* $L_{calc} = 2.766uH$

### Missing Parameters 
We are not quite ready to complete the design. Looking back at the equivalent circuit, we are still missing a few parameters: antenna capacitance, antenna resistance, and the NFC IC resistance. Typically, these parameters are determined by measuring the actual physical circuit design. For a guide on how to measure these parameters, check out the following link: --> [Guide to designing antennas for the NTAG I2C plus](https://community.nxp.com/t5/NXP-Designs-Knowledge-Base/Guide-to-designing-antennas-for-the-NTAG-I2C-plus/ta-p/1104729).  Nevertheless, we can make some rough estimations by utilizing various tools.

* Antenna resistance - By using a parasitic resistance tool in KiCad, we can calculate this parameter. According to the tool, the parasitic resistance was 1.17 ohms. 
* Antenna capacitance - By utilizing the [NXP NFC Antenna Tool](https://community.nxp.com/t5/NFC/bd-p/nfc/page/4?_gl=1*gmz3or*_ga*NzkyMDk1NzYwLjE3MTEwNTg3NTE.*_ga_WM5LE0KMSH*MTcxMTU1MzAwMS4xMy4wLjE3MTE1NTMwMDEuMC4wLjA.) we can roughly estimate this parameter. This tool does not support spiral designs, but we can use the rectangular design to estimate this parameter. According to the tool, the parasitic capacitance was 1.9 pF.
* NFC IC Resistance - Assuming the voltage should drop entirely across the IC, we can consider this resistance to be infinitely large. For our purposes, we will estimate it to be 10k ohms.

## Simulation
We can now work our way backwards to verify the parameters we calculated above. By rebuilding the equivalent circuit with these parameters in LTSpice, we can verify the resonance frequency. According to the simulation below, the resonance frequency is 13.35 MHz. This should be adequate for NFC; alternatively, we can target an inductance of 2.5-2.6 uH to achieve a resonance frequency that is closer to 13.56 MHz. Furthermore, an optional tuning capacitor can be added to get closer to 13.56 MHz.

    <img title="LTSpice Simulation" alt="LTSpice Simulation" src="./Images/LTSpice_Simulation.png" width ="75%">
</p>
<p align="center"><i>LTSpice Simulation</i></p>

I decided to rerun the simulation and redesign the antenna parameters ($D_0 = 39mm$) to target an inductance of 2.576uH. This gives us more headroom to account for any imperfections in the manufacturing process. This allows us to use a tuning capacitor to bring the resonance frequency down and closer to 13.56 MHz.

### Electromagnetic Simulation ðŸ§²
Antennas are typically simulated in electromagnetic simulation software. There are various tools available, such as:
* Ansys HFSS - The student edition does not support circuit simulation nor does it support import/export
* Solidworks CST Microwave -  The student edition does not support circuit simulation nor does it support import/export 
* openEMS
* MATLAB Antenna Toolbox

For this design, I ended up simulating it in MATLAB because I did not have access to the non-student versions of HFSS or CST.

#### MATLAB Antenna Toolbox
By utilizing [MATLAB's Antenna Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/antenna/), we can generate a spiral antenna as well as its S-parameters based on the network-matched design.

S11 represents the return loss of a device, indicating how much of the input power supplied to the device reflects back to the input port. For an NFC antenna design, it is desired for it to have the lowest gain at at 13.56 MHz. 

## PCB Design
For the final design of the antenna I ended up settling on the following parameters:
* $D_0 = 39mm$
* $t = 35um$
* $w = 300um$
* $g = 300um$
* $Nant = 6\:turns$
* $L_{calc} = 2.576uH$
* $R_{ant} = 1.17\:ohms$
* $C_{ant} = 2pF$
* $Simulated\:resonance\:frequency:\:13.75 MHz$ 
    * *Without Tuning Capacitor*

For the schematic, I borrowed the idea of an LED indicator for the energy harvesting circuit from the [PCB Business Card With NFC](https://www.instructables.com/PCB-Business-Card-With-NFC/). The capacitor is to guarantee operation during RF communication. The resistor value was chosen to limit the current going through the LED. The value was determined by using the following equation:
* $R\:=\:\frac{V_{CC}-V_{LED}}{I_{LED}}=\frac{3.2-2.25}{0.02}$
* *For the final BOM I ended up going with a green LED with a forward voltage drop of 2V. This meant that the resistor value needed to be recalculated as follows:* $R\:=\:\frac{V_{CC}-V_{LED}}{I_{LED}}=\frac{3.3-2}{0.02} = 65Î©$

* FR4-TG: TG130-140
* Thickness: 1.6mm
* Min track/spacing: 5/5mil
* Solder mask: Green
* Silkscreen: White
* Edge connector: No
* Surface finish: HASL with lead
* Via process: Tenting vias
* Finished copper: 1 oz Cu
* Remove product Num: No

## Characterization ðŸ”¬
Finally, I was able to characterize the response of the circuit by using my Analog Discovery 2 - USB oscilloscope. This was achieved by using the spectrum analyzer feature and probing both ends of the antenna. 

<p align="center">
    <img title="Spectrum Analyzer" alt="Spectrum Analyzer" src="./Images/Spectrum_Analysis.png" width ="100%">
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Spectrum Analyzer</i></p>

Surprisingly, the dominant frequency within the signal was 13.562Hz with an amplitude of 12.37dB. This was surprising, because the board I assembled above <b>did not include the tuning capacitor</b>. Based on the previous simulations we would have expected the dominant frequency to be slightly higher. Nevertheless, we can utilize the spectrum analyzer to characterize the effect the tuning capacitor has on the circuit.
